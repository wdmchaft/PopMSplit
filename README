PopMSplit

	PopMSplit allows it's user to "split" a movie (avi, flv, m4v, mkv, mov, mp4,
ogg) into multiple different segments. Along with splitting the movie
up, it can also be used to extract segments of audio and/or video from a movie
file, and to convert containers.
PopMSplit uses ffmpeg -vcodec copy option to split your movies as quickly as you
can copy them with 0 loss to quality. NO MORE RE-ENCODING!!!
But, if you want, or need to re-encode, then go ahead and do so, PopMSplit can
do that too.

To report a problem, please provide me with some info. Let me know what the
output was, just cut and past that geeky data from the Splitting Window and send
it to the above contact. Also a copy of the file you are trying to split, could
help, but not too big.
